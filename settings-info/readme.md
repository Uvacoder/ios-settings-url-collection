# ios-settings-urls

A collection of iOS Settings URLs.

From my post on [r/shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts): https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/i9rjbh/an_updated_list_of_settings_urls/

The starting point for this collection, from MacStories: https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-comprehensive-guide-to-all-120-settings-urls-supported-by-ios-and-ipados-13-1/

For a long time, I’ve relied on MacStories’ research for Settings URLs, which have no official documentation from Apple. However, as users on r/shortcuts began to request URLs that were not in the MacStories archive, I did some digging and found about 50 more. Since then, this list has continued to grow to its present form, presented here. Many of the URLs are from MacStories, but some of them are from other users' efforts or my own trial and error. I also corrected a few MacStories ones that no longer work for me.

- [The full list](/settings-urls.md), which contains all the URLs that should work on the latest version of iOS (though some have not been tested on the latest version).
- [Deprecated URLs](/deprecated.md), which worked on older versions of iOS but not the current one (at least when I tested them).

The list is also available in JSON form, which may be helpful for creating shortcuts:

- [In the same order that they appear in the Markdown-formatted list](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls/blob/master/settings-urls.json)
- [Sorted alphabetically](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls/blob/master/settings-urls-sorted.json)

[@alombi](https://github.com/alombi) has built a web app to make searching this list easier: https://ios-settings-urls.netlify.app

[@atnbueno](https://github.com/atnbueno) has built a shortcut to browse this list and make it easy to use, test, and report issues with these URLs: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5436/

There are also two lists that have not yet been added to the Markdown and JSON lists, but contain plenty of URLs and come in handy. In particular, many of these URLs include fragments, which mean that opening them scrolls to a specific item on a Settings page. These URLs were dumped from system files by @nyuszika7h. I have not yet written a reliable method to automatically pull them from the system and include them in the main list, but that will be coming soon.

- [Large list](/preference-manifest-dump.txt), from /System/Library/PreferenceManifestsInternal
- [Secondary list](/dyld-shared-cache-dump.txt), dumped from the [dyld_shared_cache](https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/Dyld_shared_cache) - contains some of the same URLs as the large list, but also some unique ones.

## The Settings URL scheme

The URL scheme to open pages in the iOS Settings app seems to be inconsistent across apps.

- For the Shortcuts app, the only URL scheme that seems to work properly with the paths is `prefs:`.
- For other apps, such as [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app), the correct scheme is `App-prefs:`. (Note the capital `A`.) **Important:** this actually doesn't seem to work when developing apps in Swift. All you can do by URL is open the main page of the Settings app. You can also open your own app's settings with the [official API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1623042-opensettingsurlstring) for doing so.

As this list was built primarily for Shortcuts users, all URLs presented here use the `prefs:` URL scheme. When you use the `App-prefs:` scheme, the rest of the URL stays the same; the scheme is the only thing that changes.

## Contributing

If you find any URLs that are not included in this list or don't work for you, issues and/or pull requests are welcomed.

~~I also respond to comments on the original Reddit post.~~ **Update:** As of 2021-02-10, the post is 180 days old and is therefore archived. No further comments can be made there, and as it is approaching the character limit for Reddit posts anyway, I have ceased updating it. All futured edits will only be made in this repository, not on the post.

You can also DM me on Reddit ([u/FifiTheBulldog](https://www.reddit.com/user/FifiTheBulldog)), mention me on Twitter ([@FifiTheBulldog](https://twitter.com/FifiTheBulldog)), or find me on the r/shortcuts Discord server (@FifiTheBulldog#6153).

New updates to the MacStories list will be added to this list as well.

## Credits

- [Federico Viticci](https://www.macstories.net/author/viticci/), for his extensive research putting together the efforts of many other users and discovering plenty of URLs on his own. His list on MacStories was the starting point for this one.
- [u/ZJ_Adram](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZJ_Adram) for scouring the file system on his jailbroken device for several SettingsSearchManifest plists, and assembling a list of URLs from those in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/lfe5d3/complete_settings_links_list/). This discovery included a treasure trove of previously undocumented URLs, which enabled me to add the majority of the Apple ID and Accessibility URLs, as well as several other previously unknown ones.
- [@atnbueno](https://github.com/atnbueno) for converting this list to JSON and checking several of the other URLs.
- [@nyuszika7h](https://github.com/nyuszika7h) for dumping URls from /System/Library/PreferenceManifestsInternal/ and dyld_shared_cache.
- [u/gluebyte](https://www.reddit.com/user/gluebyte) for going through and pointing out a few URLs from ZJ_Adram's list that I had missed.
